# Active-Suspension-MATLAB
The subject investigated in this project was the use of Active Suspension system for Tractors. The control goal in this project is to minimize the fluctuations and vibrations experienced by the tractor passengers.
By modeling this system using springs and dampers, the state space equations have been extracted and linearized. Also, the inputs of this system are considered as Control inputs and Disturbance inputs which are a model of road surface roughness.
In order to control this system, the control law is determined by using the State feedback and then according to the known control goal, the coefficients are obtained. In the last step, assuming the unavailability of some state variables, an observer is designed for the system, and the performance for the input range and specific initial conditions are examined.
